The HUMAN can select any number along a horizontal row that the cursor is on
The COMPUTER can select any number along a vertical row that the cursor is on
The state of the game is represented by a list of 4 items:
0. The game board - a matrix (list of lists) of ints. Empty cells = None,
   the comp's cells = COMPUTER and the human's = HUMAN
1. Computer's points
2. Human's points
3. Who's turn is it: HUMAN or COMPUTER
4. Next row/col
